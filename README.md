# ⛈ Rev

This is the official codes of our untitled paper *Reverberation*.
The full paper will be made avaliable soon.
Our model weights are available at [here](https://github.com/cocoon2wong/Project-Monandaeg/tree/Rev).

## Getting Started

You can clone [this repository](https://github.com/cocoon2wong/Rev) by the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cocoon2wong/Rev.git
```

Then, run the following command to initialize all submodules:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## Requirements

The codes are developed with Python 3.10.
Additional packages used are included in the `requirements.txt` file.

{: .box-warning}
**Warning:** We recommend installing all required Python packages in a virtual environment (like the `conda` environment).
Otherwise, there *COULD* be other problems due to the package version conflicts.

Run the following command to install the required packages in your Python environment:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Preparing Datasets

### ETH-UCY, SDD, NBA, nuScenes

{: .box-warning}
**Warning:** If you want to validate `Rev` models on these datasets, make sure you are getting this repository via `git clone` and that all *git submodules* have been properly initialized via `git submodule update --init --recursive`.

You can run the following commands to prepare dataset files that have been validated in our paper:

1. Run Python the script inner the `dataset_original` folder:

    ```bash
    cd dataset_original
    ```

    - For `ETH-UCY` and `SDD`, run

        ```bash
        python main_ethucysdd.py
        ```

    - For `NBA`, please download their original dataset files, put them into the given path listed within `dataset_original/main_nba.py`, then run

        ```bash
        python main_nba.py
        ```

    - For `nuScenes`, please download their dataset files, put them into the given path listed within `dataset_original/main_nuscenes.py`, then run

        ```bash
        python main_nuscenes.py
        ```

2. Back to the repo folder and create soft links:

    ```bash
    cd ..
    ln -s dataset_original/dataset_processed ./
    ln -s dataset_original/dataset_configs ./
    ```

{: .box-note}
**NOTE**: You can also download our processed dataset files manually from [here](https://github.com/cocoon2wong/Project-Luna/releases), and put them into `dataset_processed` and `dataset_configs` folders manually.

Click the following buttons to learn how we process these dataset files and the detailed dataset settings.

### Training on Your New Datasets

Before training `Rev` models on your own dataset, you should add your dataset information.
See [this page](https://cocoon2wong.github.io/Project-Luna/) for more details.

## Model Weights

We have provided our pre-trained model weights to help you quickly evaluate `Rev` models' performance.

Click the following buttons to download our model weights.
We recommend that you download the weights and place them in the `weights` folder.

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <a class="btn btn-colorful btn-lg" href="https://github.com/cocoon2wong/Project-Monandaeg/tree/Rev">⬇️ Download Weights</a>
</div>

You can start evaluating these weights by

```bash
python main.py --load SOME_MODEL_WEIGHTS
```

Here, `SOME_MODEL_WEIGHTS` is the path of the weights folder, for example, `./weights/rezara1`.

## Training

You can start training a `Rev` model via the following command:

```bash
python main.py --model rev --split DATASET_SPLIT
```

Here, `DATASET_SPLIT` is the identifier (i.e., the name of dataset's split files in `dataset_configs`, for example `eth` is the identifier of the split list in `dataset_configs/ETH-UCY/eth.plist`) of the dataset or splits used for training.
It accepts:

- ETH-UCY: {`eth`, `hotel`, `univ13`, `zara1`, `zara2`};
- SDD: `sdd`;
- NBA: `nba50k`;
- nuScenes: `nuScenes_ov_v1.0`.

For example, you can start training the `Rev` model on the `zara1` split by

```bash
python main.py --model rev --split zara1
```

Also, other args may need to be specified, like the learning rate `--lr`, batch size `--batch_size`, etc.
See detailed args in the `Args Used` Section.

## Reproducing Our Results

The simplest way to reproduce our results is to copy all training args we used in the provided weights.
For example, you can start a training of `Rev` on `zara1` using the same args as we did by:

```bash
python main.py --model rev --restore_args ${PATH_TO_YOUR_DOWNLOADED_WEIGHTS}/revzara1
```

Here, `${PATH_TO_YOUR_DOWNLOADED_WEIGHTS}` is your path to save our pretrained weights, which usually could be named as `Project-Monandaeg-Rev` after downloading.

You can open a `Tensorboard` to see how losses and metrics change during training, by:

```bash
tensorboard --logdir ./logs
```

## Visualization & Playground

We have build a simple user interface to validate the qualitative trajectory prediction performance of our proposed `Rev` models.
You can use it to visualize model predictions and learn how the proposed `Rev` works to handle social interactions in an interactive way by adding any manual neighbors at any positions in the scene.

{: .box-warning}
**WARNING**: 
Visualizations may need dataset videos. For copyright reasons and size limitations, we do not provide them in our repo. Instead, a static image will be displayed if you have no videos put into the corresponding path.

### Visualization Requirements

This playground interface is implemented with `PyQt6`.
Install this package in your python environment to start:

```bash
pip install pyqt6
```

### Open a Playground

Run the following command to open a playground:

```bash
python playground/main.py
```

![Playground](figs/playground.png)

### Load Models and Datasets

You can load a supported `Rev` model or one of its variations by clicking the `Load Model` button.
By clicking the `Run` button, you can see how the loaded model performs on the given sample.
You can also load different datasets (video clips) by clicking the `More Settings ...` button.

### Add Manual Neighbors

You can also directly click the visualized figure to add a new neighbor to the scene.
Through this neighbor that wasn't supposed to exist in the prediction scene, you can verify how models handle *social interactions* qualitatively.

## Args Used

Please specify your customized args when training or testing your model in the following way:

```bash
python main.py --ARG_KEY1 ARG_VALUE2 --ARG_KEY2 ARG_VALUE2 -SHORT_ARG_KEY3 ARG_VALUE3 ...
```

where `ARG_KEY` is the name of args, and `ARG_VALUE` is the corresponding value.

About the `argtype`:

- Args with argtype=`static` can not be changed once after training.
  When testing the model, the program will not parse these args to overwrite the saved values.
- Args with argtype=`dynamic` can be changed anytime.
  The program will try to first parse inputs from the terminal and then try to load from the saved JSON file.
